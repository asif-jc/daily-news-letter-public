Antonio Gutteres said the situation was a \"man-made disaster\" after a UN-backed body, which identifies hunger levels around the world, raised its food insecurity status in parts of the territory to Phase 5 - the highest and most severe. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) says more than half a million people across Gaza are facing \"catastrophic\" conditions characterised by \"starvation, destitution and death\". The report was labelled an \"outright lie\" by Israel, which has denied there is starvation in the territory. The UN says Israel is continuing to restrict the amount of aid entering Gaza, which Israel also denies. Its denials are in direct contradiction to what more than 100 humanitarian groups , witnesses on the ground, multiple UN bodies, and several of Israel's allies, including the UK, have said. The IPC says that an \"immediate, at-scale response\" is needed or there will be an \"unacceptable escalation\" in famine-related deaths. It predicts that between mid-August and the end of September, famine will expand across the strip to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis. Israel tells medics and aid groups to prepare for Gaza City evacuation 'My youngest child doesn't know what fruit tastes like': Gaza residents on famine During this period, almost a third of the population - nearly 641,000 people - are expected to face \"catastrophic conditions\" in IPC Phase 5, while the number of people to face \"emergency\" conditions in IPC Phase 4 will likely increase to 1.14 million - or 58% of the population. The report also projects that up to June 2026, malnutrition will threaten the lives of 132,000 children aged under five. Since the start of the war, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has reported that 271 people",
        "enhanced_summary": "This signals a critical humanitarian crisis impacting global supply chain and aid delivery strategies.  The UN has declared a famine in Gaza City, classifying over half a million people as facing catastrophic food insecurity (IPC Phase 5), a designation disputed by Israel despite widespread corroboration.  This highlights the complex geopolitical challenges in delivering humanitarian aid, particularly in conflict zones, and underscores the need for robust, transparent, and internationally coordinated emergency response systems."

US President Donald Trump has sought to bring the two leaders together, but he said on Friday \"that's like oil and vinegar... they don't get along too well\". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Putin was ready to meet Ukraine's leader \"when the agenda is ready for a summit, and this agenda is not ready at all\", accusing Zelensky of saying \"no to everything\". After an intensive week of diplomacy, in which Trump first met Putin in Alaska and then Zelensky with European leaders in Washington, the US president said the war was turning out to be the most difficult he had tried to stop. Trump said after a call with the Russian leader on Monday that he had begun arrangements for a Putin-Zelensky summit that he would join afterwards. Ukraine's president has backed the move, but he has sought security guarantees from Western allies to prevent any future Russian attack in the event of a peace deal: \"Ukraine, unlike Russia, is not afraid of any meetings between leaders.\" On a visit to Kyiv, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said Trump was aiming to \"break the deadlock\" and the alliance was working on robust security guarantees with the US and Europe to ensure Putin \"will never ever try to attack Ukraine again\". Proposed Ukraine land concessions are Putin trap, warns EU top diplomat If a Putin-Zelensky summit takes place, where could it be? Speaking alongside Rutte, Zelensky said he wanted Ukraine's security guarantees to reflect Nato's Article 5, which considers an attack on one member of the alliance an attack against all Nato members. \"This is the beginning of a big undertakin",
        "enhanced_summary": "This signals a significant shift in the geopolitical landscape surrounding the Ukraine conflict.  Russia's refusal to engage in meaningful peace talks, despite purported willingness, indicates a strategic choice to prolong the war, while Zelensky's proactive pursuit of security guarantees from Western allies underscores Ukraine's defensive posture and dependence on external support for any negotiation.  This highlights the growing importance of security guarantees and Western alliances in mediating international conflicts, reflecting a broader trend of shifting power dynamics and the limitations of direct leader-to-leader summits without robust external frameworks."

People with US visas will be under \"continuous vetting\", a state department spokesperson told the Associated Press news agency. Visas will be revoked if there are indications of \"overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organisation\", an official said. President Donald Trump has made anti-immigration the cornerstone of his second administration, from mass deportations and full-on travel bans on countries to revoking 6,000 student visas. As part of the wide-ranging review, prospective students and visitors to the US will be subjected to social media vetting with officials looking for \"any indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States\". State Department officers have also been instructed to spot individuals \"who advocate for, aid, or support designated foreign terrorists and other threats to national security; or who perpetrate unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence\".

But those who refused to try the tools when Coinbase bought enterprise licenses for GitHub Copilot and Cursor got promptly fired, CEO Brian Armstrong said this week on John Collison’s podcast“Cheeky Pint.”(Collison is the co-founder and president of the payments company Stripe.) After getting licenses to cover every engineer, some at the cryptocurrency exchange warned Armstrong that adoption would be slow, predicting it would take months to get even half the engineers using AI. Armstrong was shocked at the thought. “I went rogue,” he said, and posted a mandate in the company’s main engineering Slack channel. “I said, ‘AI is important.

This story matters because it signals a potential shift in consumer spending, supply chain dynamics, and overall inflationary pressures.

        "scraped_content": " In this article As some of the biggest names in retail, includingWalmartandHome Depot, delivered earnings results in recent weeks, they updated Wall Street on how they and their shoppers are responding to PresidentDonald Trump's wave of tariff increases. The takeaway? Tariff costs are rising for retailers, and they've had to get creative to avoid widespread price hikes. Yet consumer spending has largely stayed strong so far — and the pinch from higher duties hasn't been as severe as some companies had feared. Compared with their concerns in the spring, retail executives struck a measured tone and said they don't expect their costs, or customers' prices, to jump dramatically. Walmart hadgiven one of the strongest warningsin May, as CFO John David Rainey said he expected some prices to rise during the summer.In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, however, Rainey said the nation's biggest retailerhas raised priceson some items, but in other parts of its stores has kept prices down or expanded discounts. \"There are certainly areas where we have fully absorbed the impact of higher tariff costs,\" he said. \"There are other areas where we've had to pass some of those costs along. But when you look across the basket of items, we're certainly trying to keep prices as low as we can.\" Scot Ciccarelli, a retail analyst for Truist, said retailers are raising prices \"but not nearly to the degree that might have been expected in early April\" when Trump first announced his steep tariffs on dozens of countries. \"Most of the companies are kind of downplaying the impact of tariffs,\" he said. \"They've all talked about substantial mitigation efforts, whether that is diversifying sourcing, whether that is pushing price back to vendors.\" Here are three takeaways from a busy couple of weeks of retail earnings. The drumbeat of steady, but selective, U.S. consumer spending continued this quarter. At Walmart, the nation's largest grocer by revenue, sales of private-label items, which tend to ",
        "enhanced_summary": "This signals a shift in how retailers manage escalating import costs.  Major retailers like Walmart and Home Depot reported increased tariff costs, but mitigated the impact through price adjustments, sourcing diversification, and vendor negotiations, resulting in smaller price increases than initially feared.  This suggests a greater resilience in consumer spending and points to evolving supply chain strategies in response to ongoing trade uncertainties and the broader trend of global trade disruptions."

        "scraped_content": " In this article John Deereis facing a crossroads as the company continues to see weaker demand in the agricultural sector even while it has committed to investing millions in U.S. manufacturing and promised a brighter road ahead. The agricultural machinery companywarnedon its fiscal third-quarter earnings call last week that it is seeing much softer demand, posting significant year-over-year decreases in net income and sales. The company is working to position itself in the larger agricultural sector, which has seen growing challenges with rising costs, climate change impacts, labor shortages and more. Farmers have also been dealing with lower prices on crops like corn and grain and have pared back their spending as a result. In turn, Deere's target audience has pulled back on its willingness to buy new agricultural equipment. Deere has also been hit by tariff costs, estimating that it could take a $600 million hit for the fiscal 2025 year. The company has already seen $300 million in tariff expenses year to date. Just after reporting its earnings, the company confirmed to CNBC that it announced 238 layoffs across its Illinois and Iowa factories, adding to thousands who have been laid off over the past year. The company cited decreased demand and lower order volumes as the main factors behind the job reductions. \"As stated on our most recent earnings call, the struggling ag economy continues to impact orders for John Deere equipment,\" Deere told CNBC in a statement. \"This is a challenging time for many farmers, growers and producers, and directly impacts our business in the near term.\" The manufacturer employs more than 70,000 people globally. Still, Deere has identified enough green shoots to point to a less-troubling future. On its most recent earnings call, company executives emphasized the growth in demand in both Europe and South America after seeing weakness in North America. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Deere's president of its worldwide agriculture and ",
        "enhanced_summary": "This signals a significant shift in the agricultural equipment market, impacting tech investment in automation and precision farming.  John Deere reported decreased sales and net income due to lower agricultural commodity prices and reduced farmer spending, leading to layoffs across its US manufacturing facilities. This downturn highlights the vulnerability of even established players to macroeconomic factors and emphasizes the need for diversified revenue streams and resilient supply chains within the agtech sector."

        "scraped_content": " In March,Spirit Airlinescame out ofbankruptcy protectionin less than four months and entered a worsening landscape. Consumers were holding off booking flights and U.S. planes were awash in empty seats. Even the most profitable airlines cut the rosy financial forecasts they had issued at the start of the year. But Spirit, an airline with bright yellow planes that has becomesynonymouswith budget travel in the U.S., now appears on even shakier ground. Last week, five months after getting out of bankruptcy, Spiritwarnedit might not be able to survive a year without more cash and that its credit card processor was seeking more collateral. On Thursday, Spiritsaidit borrowed the entire $275 million available under its revolver. It also reached a two-year extension on its credit card processing agreement with U.S. Bank National Association to hold back up to $3 million a day. Industry experts said the airline avoided making hard decisions before or during bankruptcy protection, such as renegotiating aircraft leases or shrinking the carrier altogether. Instead, the airline in bankruptcy reached a deal with bondholders, who exchanged debt for equity. \"It made it that much more unlikely for them to succeed without having tackled some of those issues,\" said Joe Rohlena, airline analyst at Fitch Ratings, which downgraded Spirit last Friday, saying the company might be unable to avoid a default because of its cash burn. Bankruptcy attorney Brett Miller, U.S. co-chair of the restructuring department at Willkie Farr & Gallagher who represented the creditors' committee, said Spirit \"didn't use the tools available to them in Chapter 11\" for bigger changes. Spirit had forecast a net profit of $252 million this year, according to acourt filingfrom December. Butits reportlast week said it instead lost nearly $257 million since March 13, after it exited Chapter 11 through the end of June. Shares ofSpirit Aviation Holdingshave dropped close to 58% since its \"going concern\" warning earlie",
        "enhanced_summary": "Spirit Airlines' post-bankruptcy struggles signal a significant challenge for budget airlines relying on unsustainable financial models.  The airline, emerging from bankruptcy protection in March, quickly faced severe cash flow problems, issuing a going-concern warning and maxing out its credit lines just five months later due to its failure to address fundamental issues like renegotiating leases during bankruptcy proceedings. This highlights the risk of avoiding difficult restructuring decisions during bankruptcy, potentially leading to further financial distress and illustrating the vulnerability of low-cost carriers in the face of economic downturns and evolving industry dynamics."
