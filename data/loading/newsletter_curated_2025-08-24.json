North Korean state media called the shots a \"deliberate provocation\" and Pyongyang has accused Seoul of risking \"uncontrollable\" tensions. The incident was made public as new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung departed Seoul on Saturday for a visit to Tokyo and Washington. Pyongyang has upped the ante in recent weeks, with leader Kim Jong Un's sister rebuffing efforts towards reconciliation made by Lee's government. The incident took place amid continuing work by North Korea since last year to permanently seal its border with the South. A strip of no-man's land called the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separates the north and south, with intrusions often increasing tensions . The DMZ border is not fenced and the signposts are obscured by dense vegetation. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement that some North Korean troops working in the border region crossed the military demarcation line between the two countries at about 15:00 local time in Seoul on Tuesday (07:00 BST). The soldiers later moved back to the north of the line, the JCS added. North Korean Army Lt Gen Ko Jong Chol said Seoul's military used a machine gun to fire more than 10 warning shots towards its soldiers, according to state media. \"This is a very serious prelude that would inevitably drive the situation in the southern border area where a huge number of forces are stationing in confrontation with each other to the uncontrollable phase,\" state media said he added.

        "enhanced_summary": "This incident underscores the fragility of the Korean Peninsula's peace and highlights the risks of escalating tensions.  North Korean soldiers briefly crossed the DMZ into South Korean territory, prompting South Korean troops to fire warning shots,  a response that North Korea condemned as a provocation. This renewed border incursion, coupled with recent rhetoric from Pyongyang, indicates a potential return to heightened military activity and jeopardizes ongoing diplomatic efforts, particularly given the new South Korean president's focus on regional engagement."

The US National Archives said the records it released ahead of the 70th anniversary of the African-American youth's killing were \"watershed moment in American history\". Emmett Till, a 14-year-old from Chicago, was visiting family in Mississippi when he was brutally beaten and killed after a white woman claimed he harassed her at a store. Till's lynching and the subsequent activism of his mother Mamie Till-Mobley helped galvanise the civil rights movement in the US. It was only in 2022 that the US signed the Emmett Till Anti-Lynching Act into law, which makes lynching a federal hate crime offence. More than 6,500 pages of records have been released to the public - ranging from previously undisclosed case files to public materials such as magazine and newspaper clippings. The files, created by the Civil Rights Cold Case Records Review Board, are an initial release of federal records related to the case, the National Archives said. \"The release of these records is nothing short of historic,\" said board co-chair Margaret Burnham. \"Emmett's family members, as well as historians and the public at large, have deserved a complete picture of the federal government's response,\" Ms Burnham said. \"The story of Emmett Till and the injustices done to him is still being written, but these documents offer up some long-overdue clarity.\" The death of the teenager is thought to have led to the 1957 Civil Rights Act. Who was Emmett Till? On 24 August 1955, Emmett Till was visiting family and entered a store in Money, Mississippi, where Carolyn Bryant, then 21, worked.

The question behind the Air Canada strike 7 hours ago Share Save Nadine Yousif BBC News, Toronto Share Save Getty Images For decades, North America's flight attendants were not paid for work they did on the ground When Air Canada flight attendants walked off the job earlier a week ago, they had one rallying cry: \"Unpaid work won't fly.\" It was a reference to the long-standing practice in North America's aviation industry of not paying cabin crew for work they do when they are on the ground, before the plane is in motion. In contrast, some European airlines, industry experts told the BBC, pay cabin crew monthly wages rather than by the hour. The pay structure surprised Canadian flyers, many of whom supported the striking workers, one poll commissioned by the union suggested . The brief strike wreaked havoc during the peak summer travel season, but flights resumed after both sides agreed to a tentative deal on Tuesday. The proposed agreement reached by the Canadian Union for Public Employees (Cupe) and Air Canada has not been fully released, but those familiar with its contents report that it includes a pay bump over several years and, most notably, partial pay for boarding duties and cabin secure checks before take off - a first. Experts say the wins secured by Air Canada's cabin crew could help solidify a new standard for aviation workers on the continent. The union called it \"historic\" earlier this week, declaring unpaid work \"over\". But media has reported that many flight attendants, who must still vote to approve the deal, remain dissatisfied. It is unclear if the deal has enough support to pass, Reuters reported. Watch: 'We do support what the flight attendants are trying to achieve' - Air Canada passengers react to strike Air Canada flight attendants were not alone in not being paid for what the industry calls \"ground work\". Cabin crew for other Canadian airlines Air Transat and WestJet do not have ground pay as part of their compensa",
        "enhanced_summary": "This Air Canada strike highlights the long-standing issue of unpaid ground work for flight attendants, impacting labor standards across North American aviation.  The strike, resulting from Air Canada's refusal to compensate flight attendants for pre-flight duties, ended with a tentative agreement including partial pay for this work – a significant precedent.  This outcome could signal a broader shift towards improved compensation and working conditions for aviation workers continent-wide, influencing negotiations and potentially setting a new industry standard, although the agreement still requires union ratification."

A patient has to physically attempt to speak to make these implants work, which is tiresome for severely paralyzed people. To go around it, researchers at the Stanford University built a BCI that could decode inner speech—the kind we engage in silent reading and use for all our internal monologues. The problem is that those inner monologues often involve stuff we don’t want others to hear. To keep their BCI from spilling the patients’ most private thoughts, the researchers designed a first-of-its-kind “mental privacy” safeguard. Overlapping signals The reason nearly all neural prostheses used for speech are designed to decode attempted speech is that our first idea was to try the same thing we did with controlling artificial limbs: record from the area of the brain responsible for controlling muscles. “Attempted movements produced very strong signal, and we thought it could also be used for speech,” says Benyamin Meschede Abramovich Krasa, a neuroscientist at Stanford University who, along with Erin M. Kunz, was a co-lead author of the study. The vocal tract, at the end of the day, relies on the movement of muscles. Fishing out the sig",

This highlights the urgent need for robust ethical guidelines and technological safeguards as BCI technology advances and integrates more deeply into society, particularly given parallel developments in AI and speech synthesis."
