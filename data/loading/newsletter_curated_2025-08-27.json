This makes India - one of the US's strongest partners in the Indo-Pacific - among the countries paying the highest tariffs in the world. This could deal a blow to exports and growth in the world's fifth largest economy, given that the US was, until recently, India's largest trading partner. The tariff setback has sent the Indian government into firefighting mode. Earlier this month, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a promise to cut taxes to mitigate their economic impact. He has also rallied for domestic self-reliance. He said that a Diwali gift in the form of a \"massive tax bonanza\" was on its way for the common man and the millions of small businesses that power Asia's third largest economy. Wearing a bright saffron turban and addressing crowds of spectators from the ramparts of Delhi's Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations, Modi also urged small shop owners and businesses to put up boards of \"Swadeshi\" or \"Made in India\" outside their stores. \"We should become self-reliant - not out of desperation, but out of pride,\" he said. \"Economic selfishness is on the rise globally and we mustn't sit and cry about our difficulties, we must rise above and not allow others to hold us in their clutches.\" He has since repeated these comments in at least two other public addresses this week. For many watching, this is clearly aimed at countering Donald Trump's brutal 50% tariff rate on India which will disrupt millions of livelihoods across the country's export-driven industries t",
        "enhanced_summary": "This significantly impacts US-India trade relations and global supply chains.  The US imposed a 50% tariff on Indian goods, escalating existing trade tensions and prompting India's Prime Minister Modi to promote domestic self-reliance (\"Make in India\") initiatives. This could reshape global manufacturing landscapes as India seeks to reduce its dependence on the US market and foster internal economic growth, potentially leading to new sourcing strategies for US businesses."

A political activist, Goonei was in solitary confinement in Iran's notorious Evin Prison when it was hit in a targeted attack by Israel on 23 June. Satellite imagery, witness accounts and verified footage obtained by BBC News Persian reveal new details of the attack in the closing hours of the Israel-Iran war and of those who died. The high-security complex, perched on the northern edge of Tehran, has held thousands of political prisoners over the past half-century. On that day in June, the prison became the site of the deadliest Israeli strike on Iranian soil in terms of civilian casualties. Iranian authorities say 80 people were killed - among them prison staff, inmates, medical workers, visitors and residents of nearby neighbourhoods. In a report published on 14 August, Human Rights Watch said that Israeli air strikes on the prison were unlawfully indiscriminate and amounted to an apparent war crime. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the reason for the attack was that the facility was being \"used for intelligence operations against Israel\". 'No way out' Describing the moment explosions ripped through the compound, Goonei said: \"When I heard the third blast, I was certain there was no way out. I just pounded on the door with all my strength, but it wouldn't open. I thought 'this is the end of your life - say goodbye'.\" Supplied Motahareh Goonei has been temporarily released from prison on bail Freed from her cell by another prisoner, Goonei stumbled into thick, choking smoke.

Israel launched a missile strike on Iran's Evin Prison in June, resulting in numerous civilian casualties, according to witness accounts, satellite imagery, and reports from Human Rights Watch which deemed the attack an apparent war crime.  This escalation of the conflict highlights the growing risks of collateral damage and the potential for further human rights violations in targeted military operations, underscoring the need for greater international oversight and accountability in warfare."

It may be deemed impractical and may never happen, but the concept is yet another move by Moscow to seek a geopolitical advantage over Western nations. Niger has historically exported the metal for further refining in France, but that is changing as the military-led country cuts off ties with the former colonial power. The uranium-mining operation operated by French nuclear group Orano was nationalised in June, which cleared the way for Russia to put itself forward as a new partner. It is talking about power generation and medical applications, with a focus on training local expertise under a co-operation agreement signed between Russian-state corporation Rosatom and the Nigerien authorities. If ever brought to fruition this would be the first nuclear power project in West Africa. Beyond initial discussions, it is unclear how far down this road things will progress. But already, with this first move, Moscow has shown that it grasps the depth of local frustrations. AFP/Getty Images Uranium has been mined in Niger for years - this is the dump site from a now-depleted uranium mine in Niger For more than five decades Orano - which until 2018 was known as Areva - mined Niger's uranium, to supply the nuclear power sector that is at the heart of France's energy strategy. The French government-owned company now gets most of its supplies from Canada and Kazakhstan and has projects in development in Mongolia and Uzbekistan. But the Nigerien connection remained significant and freighted with a degree of political and perhaps even cultural weight. Yet Paris did not share its nuclear energy knowhow with its loyal African supplier. Niger, meanwhile, has to rely largely o",

AT&T said it will use the spectrum to boost its 5G mobile network and expand its fixed wireless home Internet service. The AT&T/EchoStar deal, which is expected to be completed in mid-2026, could mark the beginning of EchoStar's spectrum portfolio being carved up and sold to other carriers. Starlink operator SpaceX has sought access to some of EchoStar's spectrum, alleging that the company isn't putting it to good use. An EchoStar announcement today said, \"EchoStar has entered into a definitive agreement with AT&T to sell the company's 3.45 GHz and 600 MHz spectrum licenses—a total of 50 MHz of nationwide spectrum—for approximately $23 billion, subject to regulatory approval.

        "scraped_content": " In this article Eli Lillyon Tuesday said itsdaily weight loss pillhelped patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes shed weight in a late-stage trial, meeting the study's main goal and clearing the way for the company tofile for approval of the drugglobally. The treatment is inching closer to becoming a new, needle-free alternative in the highly lucrative market for weight loss and diabetes drugs called GLP-1s. More convenient pills could boost supply for the treatments and make them easier to access than the pricey weekly injections currently dominating the space. The Eli Lilly pill also would not come with dietary restrictions, in contrast to a similar oral treatment from chief rival Novo Nordisk. Eli Lilly shares climbed more than 4% on Tuesday. The highest dose of the pill, orforglipron, helped patients lose 10.5% of their weight, or 22.9 pounds, on average at 72 weeks, compared with 2.2% weight loss among those who took a placebo. The drug's weight loss in the study was 9.6% when analyzing all patients regardless of discontinuations. Eli Lilly's pill met the trial's other goals of helping patients lower their hemoglobin A1C, a measure of blood sugar levels. By the end of the study, most patients no longer met the criteria for Type 2 diabetes based on that metric. The rate of side effects and treatment discontinuations in the study, called ATTAIN-2, appeared to be generally consistent with two recent phase three trials on Eli Lilly's drug. Eli Lilly said it now has the full clinical trial data package required to file for approvals of the drug for chronic weight management with global regulators. The pharmaceutical giant expects to launch the pill around the world \"this time next year,\" CEO David Rickstold CNBC in early August. In an interview, Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer, Daniel Skovronsky, said the pill had \"unprecedented efficacy\" in patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes, who typically have a more difficult time losing weight compared with those ",
        "enhanced_summary": "This significantly expands access to effective weight-loss treatments.  Eli Lilly's orforglipron, a daily oral medication, successfully completed late-stage trials demonstrating significant weight loss in obese patients with Type 2 diabetes, exceeding placebo results and paving the way for global regulatory approval.  This development could disrupt the current injectable GLP-1 market by offering a more convenient and potentially less expensive alternative, driving increased adoption and competition in the obesity and diabetes therapeutics sector."

While the White House recently announced anagreement with Europe on a 15% tariff rate,that rate hasn't yet taken effect for cars. Lamborghini and other European automakers are still paying a tariff rate of 27.5% on exports to the U.S. With the price of a Lamborghini starting at $400,000, many buyers are choosing to wait for more stable tariff rates before buying, Winkelmann said. \"Some are waiting because they want to be sure that this is the final number that is going to be in place,\" Winkelmann said. \"Others are fine with it, or we will have negotiations.\" The Inside Wealth newsletter by Robert Frank is your weekly guide to high-net-worth investors and the industries that serve them.

He said Lamborghinis can't be produced in the U.S., since the \"made in Italy\" promise is core to the brand. And he said that even the wealthy are sensitive to price increases. \"They are millionaires or billionaires for a reason, so they know what they're doing and why they're doing things,\" he said. \"For us, free trade is the right approach. We all know that is what we want. But then there is the reality, and we have to deal with complexity, since we are in business. ... We are ready to face whatever comes.\" For now, the company is fairly insulated from any immediate drop-off in demand, since it has a large back order.

Consumers are increasingly concerned about the state of the economy, and that is affecting yet another real estate sector — student housing. Rent growth in the sector slowed to just 0.9% in July across 200 colleges surveyed by Yardi. The average advertised asking rent fell to $905 per bed, a 1.4% decrease from the $918 peak in March \"as operators struggle to lease remaining inventory,\" according to the Yardi report. For perspective, from October through July, rent growth averaged 2.8%, less than half the 5.7% recorded during the same period a year earlier and well below the 6.9% seen a year before that. \"What we're seeing is fall-off at the top and the bottom,\" said Robert Bronstein, founder and CEO of Scion, one of the country's largest owners and operators of student housing. Scion owns roughly 95,000 beds across 83 schools in 35 states, with over $10 billion in assets under management. Bronstein said the lower end of the market, that is, students and parents who were struggling most to afford student housing, is now going back to the more historic, cheaper rental homes on the outskirts of campuses. Higher-end students and parents are also changing course. \"I think that people are saying, 'You know what, there's a building that's three years old, and it costs 30% less than a brand new building, and I wasn't going to use the hot tub on the roof anyhow. I'm going to go with the less expensive option,'\" said Bronstein.

        "enhanced_summary": "This signals a shift in the student housing market, away from luxury amenities and towards affordability.  July data shows slowing rent growth (0.9%) and even rent decreases (1.4%) in the sector, with both high-end and budget-conscious students opting for cheaper housing options.
