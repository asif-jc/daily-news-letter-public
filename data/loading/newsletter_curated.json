        "scraped_content": "Russia outsmarts France with nuclear power move in Niger 6 hours ago Share Save Paul Melly West Africa analyst Share Save EPA Russia has dangled the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in uranium-rich Niger - a vast, arid state on the edge of the Sahara desert that has to import most of its electricity. It may be deemed impractical and may never happen, but the concept is yet another move by Moscow to seek a geopolitical advantage over Western nations. Niger has historically exported the metal for further refining in France, but that is changing as the military-led country cuts off ties with the former colonial power. The uranium-mining operation operated by French nuclear group Orano was nationalised in June, which cleared the way for Russia to put itself forward as a new partner. It is talking about power generation and medical applications, with a focus on training local expertise under a co-operation agreement signed between Russian-state corporation Rosatom and the Nigerien authorities. If ever brought to fruition this would be the first nuclear power project in West Africa. Beyond initial discussions, it is unclear how far down this road things will progress. But already, with this first move, Moscow has shown that it grasps the depth of local frustrations.",
        "enhanced_summary": "This signals a significant shift in West African energy and geopolitical power dynamics.  Russia has proposed building Niger's first nuclear power plant, leveraging the nation's uranium reserves and exploiting its strained relationship with France,  nationalizing a key French-owned uranium mining operation.  This move underscores Russia's broader strategy of expanding its influence in Africa through energy partnerships, challenging established Western dominance and potentially accelerating the adoption of nuclear energy in a resource-rich but underdeveloped region."

A political activist, Goonei was in solitary confinement in Iran's notorious Evin Prison when it was hit in a targeted attack by Israel on 23 June. Satellite imagery, witness accounts and verified footage obtained by BBC News Persian reveal new details of the attack in the closing hours of the Israel-Iran war and of those who died. The high-security complex, perched on the northern edge of Tehran, has held thousands of political prisoners over the past half-century. On that day in June, the prison became the site of the deadliest Israeli strike on Iranian soil in terms of civilian casualties. Iranian authorities say 80 people were killed - among them prison staff, inmates, medical workers, visitors and residents of nearby neighbourhoods. In a report published on 14 August, Human Rights Watch said that Israeli air strikes on the prison were unlawfully indiscriminate and amounted to an apparent war crime. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the reason for the attack was that the facility was being \"used for intelligence operations against Israel\".",

Israel launched a targeted strike on the prison, resulting in numerous civilian casualties according to multiple sources, including witness testimonies and satellite imagery, prompting accusations of war crimes from Human Rights Watch.  This incident highlights the growing risk of unintended consequences from targeted attacks in densely populated areas and exacerbates existing tensions in the Middle East, potentially impacting geopolitical stability and future technological arms races in the region."

This makes India - one of the US's strongest partners in the Indo-Pacific - among the countries paying the highest tariffs in the world. This could deal a blow to exports and growth in the world's fifth largest economy, given that the US was, until recently, India's largest trading partner. The tariff setback has sent the Indian government into firefighting mode. Earlier this month, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a promise to cut taxes to mitigate their economic impact. He has also urged domestic self-reliance. He said that a Diwali gift in the form of a \"massive tax bonanza\" was on its way for the common man and the millions of small businesses that power Asia's third largest economy. Wearing a bright saffron turban and addressing crowds of spectators from the ramparts of Delhi's Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations, Modi also urged small shop owners and businesses to put up boards of \"Swadeshi\" or \"Made in India\" outside their stores.",
