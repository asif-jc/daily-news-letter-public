The president has said there was \"sufficient reason\" to believe Cook had made false statements on her mortgage, and cited constitutional powers which he said allowed him to remove her. The unprecedented move comes as Trump has put increasing pressure on the Fed - especially its chair Jerome Powell - over what he sees as an unwillingness to lower interest rates. Reuters Cook is one of seven members of the Fed's board of governors and the first African American woman to serve in the role Trump vs the Fed: Why this row could rattle the US economy Who is Lisa Cook, and what is Federal Reserve governor accused of? Long-term US government bonds were sold off on Tuesday, suggesting that investors are concerned about the Federal Reserve's independence after Trump's attempt to fire one of the central bank's governors. If investors start to doubt the Fed's credibility, borrowing costs for the US government could rise \u2013 and that would have knock-on effects around the world since they are used to set the price of assets. Cook is one of seven members of the Fed's board of governors, and in this position sits on the 12-member committee which is responsible for setting interest rates in the US. \"His attempt to fire her, based solely on a referral letter, lacks any factual or legal basis,\" Cook's lawyer said on Tuesday.",

This unprecedented attack on the Fed's independence raises serious concerns about the central bank's credibility, potentially impacting investor confidence, increasing government borrowing costs, and creating ripple effects across global financial markets."

This makes India - one of the US's strongest partners in the Indo-Pacific - among the countries hit with the highest tariffs in the world. This could deal a blow to exports and growth in the world's fifth largest economy, given that the US was, until recently, India's largest trading partner. The tariff setback has sent the Indian government into firefighting mode. Earlier this month, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a promise to cut taxes to mitigate their economic impact. He has also urged domestic self-reliance. He said that a Diwali gift in the form of a \"massive tax bonanza\" was on its way for the common man and the millions of small businesses that power Asia's third largest economy. Wearing a bright saffron turban and addressing crowds of spectators from the ramparts of Delhi's Red Fort during Independence Day celebrations, Modi also urged small shop owners and businesses to put up boards of \"Swadeshi\" or \"Made in India\" outside their stores.",

Late on Monday, he posted on his Truth Social account a letter addressed to Lisa Cook, saying she was being removed from the Federal Reserve Board of Governors due to mortgage fraud allegations. The move has caused an outcry from Democrats who say it amounts to unprecedented political interference. Who is Lisa Cook and what does she do? Ms Cook was appointed as governor of the Federal Reserve in 2022 by Democratic President Joe Biden, becoming the first African American to serve in the role. Her term was due to end in 2038. She previously served on Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers and worked at the US Treasury.

From cradle to grave, the company said the manufacturing, use, and disposal of the then-new model didn\u2019t contribute to global warming. Now, a German court says that Apple has to recant the claim. Each aluminum Apple WatchSeries 9andSeries 10\u2014 two models with the carbon-neutral designation \u2014 generates just over 8 kilograms of carbon emissions. Apple then offsets those emissions through the purchase of carbon credits. The German environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) brought the lawsuit against Apple. \u201cThe Court has broadly upheld our rigorous approach to carbon neutrality,\u201d an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch via email. \u201cWe remain laser focused on further reducing emissions by industry-leading innovation in clean energy, low-carbon design and more \u2014 work that has put us on track to achieve carbon neutrality throughout our entire supply chain by 2030.",
        "enhanced_summary": "A German court ruled that Apple cannot claim its Watch Series 9 and 10 are carbon neutral, despite Apple offsetting the devices' emissions through carbon credits, following a lawsuit by the environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe.  This decision highlights the increasing scrutiny around corporate sustainability claims and the potential legal ramifications of greenwashing, forcing companies to more rigorously substantiate their environmental commitments to maintain consumer and investor trust."

In a letter to Orsted, the Danish company developing Revolution Wind, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said its order is tied to concerns about \u201cthe protection of national security interests of the United States and prevention of interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas. \u201d The letter did not explain why the project posed national security concerns or interfered with reasonable uses of the area. BOEM did not respond to emailed questions. The order follows a Thursday announcement from the US Commerce Department that it had initiated an investigation on August 13 into \u201cthe effects on the national security of imports of wind turbines and their parts and components,\u201d which could allow Trump to apply increased tariffs to wind turbines.",
        "enhanced_summary": "The Trump administration halted an almost-finished offshore wind project developed by Orsted, citing vaguely defined national security concerns, effectively stopping power for over 350,000 homes.  This action, coupled with a parallel investigation into wind turbine imports, signals a significant setback for renewable energy development and highlights the potential for politically motivated interventions to disrupt long-term energy strategies and investments."
