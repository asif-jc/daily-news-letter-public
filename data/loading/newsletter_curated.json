They are all that remain of what was once a much bigger manufacturing operation, most of which the Teixeira family shut down in 1990, reinventing their business as a largely warehousing and distribution business. Since US President Donald Trump started rolling out sweeping tariffs, the Teixeiras have been fielding more inquiries from companies newly interested in their US-based sewing services. But they have turned down those offers, deterred by the difficulty of hiring in the midst of an immigration crackdown and doubts that the demand will be sustained. It's just one of the many indications that achieving the manufacturing revival promised by the president is likely to be far more difficult than the White House has claimed. \"It's just not going to happen,\" said Frank Teixeira, who joined the family business in the 1970s and oversaw its dismantling and reinvention as Accurate Services Inc. \"Tariffs are a bad policy and eventually are going to come home to haunt us. \" Trump campaigned for the presidency on the promise of a better economy, engineered in part by tariffs that he said would lower costs and usher in a new golden age.",
        "enhanced_summary": "In Fall River, Massachusetts, the Teixeira family, owners of Accurate Services, are facing increased demand for their US-based sewing services due to Trump-era tariffs, but are unable to scale up due to hiring challenges stemming from immigration policies and uncertainty about sustained demand.  This highlights the significant difficulties in achieving a promised US manufacturing revival solely through tariffs, showcasing the complex interplay between trade policy, labor markets, and the practical realities of business growth."

Ina blog post summarizing the paper, OpenAI defines hallucinations as \u201cplausible but false statements generated by language models,\u201d and it acknowledges that despite improvements, hallucinations \u201cremain a fundamental challenge for all large language models\u201d \u2014 one that will never be completely eliminated.

(Kalai is one of the paper\u2019s authors. ) They then asked about his birthday and received three different dates. Once again, all of them were wrong. How can a chatbot be so wrong \u2014 and sound so confident in its wrongness? The researchers suggest that hallucinations arise, in part, because of a pretraining process that focuses on getting models to correctly predict the next word, without true or false labels attached to the training statements: \u201cThe model sees only positive examples of fluent language and must approximate the overall distribution.",
