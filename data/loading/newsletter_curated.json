        "scraped_content": "UN sanctions against Iran to resume over banned nuclear activity 59 minutes ago Share Save Lyse Doucet Chief international correspondent, New York and Raffi Berg Share Save EPA Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian spoke at the UN General Assembly The United Nations' sweeping economic and military sanctions look set to be reimposed on Iran a decade after they were lifted in a landmark international deal over its nuclear programme. It comes after the UK, France and Germany wrote to the UN Security Council last month, accusing Iran of failing to fulfil its commitments. That triggered a mechanism giving Iran 30 days to find a diplomatic solution to avert renewed sanctions. Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian condemned the re-imposition of international sanctions as \"unfair, unjust, and illegal\". A last-minute resolution, led by China and Russia, to delay the move by six months only received four votes in the 15-member council. The sanctions are set to come into force at 00:00 GMT on Sunday. Iran stepped up banned nuclear activity after the US quit the deal in 2016. Donald Trump pulled the US out in his first term as US president, criticising the deal - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - negotiated under his predecessor Barack Obama as flawed.",
        "enhanced_summary": "UN sanctions are poised to be reimposed on Iran after the UK, France, and Germany accused Iran of violating its nuclear commitments, a decade after sanctions were lifted in a landmark nuclear deal. Despite condemnation from Iran's President and attempts by China and Russia to delay the move, the sanctions are expected to be reinstated, triggered by Iran stepping up its banned nuclear activity after the US withdrew from the JCPOA in 2016.",
        "why_matters": "This development signals a potential escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, impacting global trade and energy markets. Businesses should be aware of renewed economic restrictions impacting Iranian markets and trade partnerships, potentially leading to supply chain disruptions and increased risk for investments in the region. This also reflects a shift in international diplomacy, highlighting the fragility of international agreements and the challenges of nuclear non-proliferation efforts."

        "scraped_content": "Canada's postal workers strike, bring mail deliveries to a halt 14 hours ago Share Save Kwasi Gyamfi Asiedu Share Save NurPhoto via Getty Images Canada Post workers have begun a nationwide strike after the federal government authorised widespread reforms that would shut some post offices and end certain types of deliveries. The Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) called the proposals an \"attack on our postal service and workers\" as it announced the industrial action. The strike by the union's 55,000 members comes amid an ongoing dispute over postal worker's pay and benefits that resulted in a weeks-long walkout late last year. Canada Post said operations will shut down during the strike, leaving mail and parcels undelivered for millions, adding that this would compound the corporation's already dire financial woes. The sweeping changes announced by the federal government follows years of financial losses sustained by the postal service, which faces reduced demand and stiff competition from private parcel delivery services. Procurement minister Jo\u00ebl Lightbound said on Thursday that Canada Post lost C$1bn ($717; \u00a3535m) last year and is on track to lose C$1. \"Canada Post is effectively insolvent, and repeated bailouts are not a long-term solution,\" he said in a statement. The proposed changes would see the closure of several post offices in areas that were once rural and give the service more flexibility to raise prices.",
        "enhanced_summary": "Canadian postal workers have initiated a nationwide strike in response to government-authorized reforms that include post office closures and delivery changes. This action, led by the Canadian Union of Postal Workers (CUPW) with its 55,000 members, halts mail and parcel deliveries across the country.",
        "why_matters": "This strike highlights the tension between public services struggling with financial viability and the need to modernize in the face of changing consumer demands and private sector competition. It signals potential disruptions to Canadian businesses and consumers reliant on postal services and could indicate a broader trend of governments seeking to restructure or cut back on traditionally guaranteed public services. This will also influence companies and consumers to seek alternative, non-unionized solutions for shipping and deliveries."

The redomiciling process has received in-principle approvals from a Singapore court, while several hearings have already taken place at India\u2019s National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), people familiar with the matter told TechCrunch. Flipkart is working toward completing the transition within the next couple of months, aligning with India\u2019s festive season \u2014 a critical sales period \u2014 and laying the groundwork for a public listing expected as early as 2026.

It also makes sense to tap India\u2019s public markets, given the expanding retail investor base and rising appetite for IPOs.

That dream has changed. In a modification to the contract announced earlier this week, NASA and Sierra Space agreed to remove the agency\u2019s guarantee to purchase cargo flights to the ISS. Instead, the Dream Chaser spaceplane will debut in a free-flying demonstration in late 2026, and will not dock with the station. NASA said it will provide \u201cminimal support\u201d for that test, and only afterward decide whether to order ISS resupply missions at all. The contract change is a blow to the Dream Chaser program. Typically, such programs rely heavily, if not entirely, on government support, as the upfront development costs for a crewed or cargo spacecraft are so high that commercial customers are rarely able to provide enough demand to close the business case.

Sign upto receive future editions, straight to your inbox. Investment firms of the ultra-wealthy, such as the family office of Jeff Bezos, are making headlines with massive fundraises for artificial intelligence startups. Late last month,Bezos Expeditionsco-led a $405 million round for robotics startup Field AI with backers including Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective. In the past six months alone,Hillspire, the family office of Google billionaire Eric Schmidt, has backed at least six AI startups, per data provided exclusively to CNBC by Fintrx, a private wealth intelligence platform. But while tech unicorns get most of the buzz, family offices prefer to invest in the AI boom via public equities, according to a recent poll by Goldman Sachs. The bank's survey of 245 worldwide family offices found that 52% are exposed to AI through primary public equities or ETFs, while only a quarter reported investing directly in AI startups. Goldman Sachs' Meena Flynn told Inside Wealth that family offices likely have even greater exposure through stocks than they realize.",
        "enhanced_summary": "Family offices, including those of Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt, are increasingly investing in AI. However, despite high-profile startup investments, a Goldman Sachs poll reveals that most family offices prefer exposure to AI through public equities and ETFs rather than directly investing in AI startups.",
        "why_matters": "This suggests family offices, while interested in AI's potential, are taking a more cautious and potentially more liquid approach to investing in the sector, favoring established companies over the higher risk and illiquidity of venture capital. This trend signals a desire for diversification and potentially a perceived overvaluation in the AI startup market, which could impact funding dynamics for early-stage AI companies."
