More than 300 South Koreans who were arrested in the raid have now been released from detention and are due to return home on Friday after having their release delayed by more than a day. Their departure was delayed because of an instruction from the White House, Lee added.

Lee, who was speaking at a news conference to mark the first 100 days of his presidency, said \"the situation is extremely bewildering,\" while noting it is common practice for Korean firms to send workers to help set up overseas factories. \"If that's no longer allowed, establishing manufacturing facilities in the US will only become more difficult. making companies question whether it's worth doing at all,\" he added.

There are more than 100 different species of the peacock spider, whereas most animals have only five or ten. Researchers believe that's partly down to the spider's 'dark DNA' - a mysterious part of the animal's genetic code, and they are studying it to find out more. They think that this dark DNA might enable it to adapt rapidly to changing environmental circumstances by developing into new species. What the scientists find out, they say, might help to explain why there is so much variation in the natural world. \"We are interested in how the spiders evolve to become that diverse,\" Jonah Walker, of the Sanger Institute told BBC News. \"When you go outside you see so much variation in species of plants and animals,\" he said.",

The US Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit rejected Verizon's challenge in a ruling issued today. The Federal Communications Commission fined the three major carriers last year for violations revealed in 2018. The companies sued the FCC in three different courts, with varying results. AT&T beat the FCC in the reliably conservative US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, while T-Mobile lost in the District of Columbia Circuit.",
        "enhanced_summary": "A US appeals court upheld a $46.9 million fine against Verizon for selling customer location data without consent, rejecting their legal challenge and creating a circuit split after similar cases involving AT&T and T-Mobile yielded different outcomes.  This highlights the significant legal and reputational risks associated with handling user data without explicit consent, forcing companies to re-evaluate data privacy practices and potentially leading to further legal battles or regulatory changes impacting the entire telecom industry."
