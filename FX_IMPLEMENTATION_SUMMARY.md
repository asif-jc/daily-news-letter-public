# Foreign Exchange Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added foreign exchange rates functionality to the daily newsletter with the following currency pairs:
- NZD/USD (New Zealand Dollar to US Dollar)
- NZD/AUD (New Zealand Dollar to Australian Dollar)  
- NZD/INR (New Zealand Dollar to Indian Rupee)
- NZD/CNY (New Zealand Dollar to Chinese Yuan)
- USD/BTC (US Dollar to Bitcoin)

## Files Modified

### 1. `foreign_exchange_data.py` - COMPLETED
- Implemented API calls to fetch real exchange rates
- Uses exchangerate-api.com for traditional currency pairs (free tier, no API key needed)
- Uses CoinGecko API for Bitcoin rates (free tier, no API key needed)
- Includes fallback to CoinDesk API for Bitcoin if CoinGecko fails
- Returns properly formatted data with NZ timezone timestamps
- Includes error handling and test functions

### 2. `web_newsletter.py` - COMPLETED
- Added import for `foreign_exchange_data`
- Added CSS styling for FX box matching existing article styling
- Added `generate_fx_box()` method to create HTML for exchange rates
- Integrated FX box into main HTML generation (positioned after header, before articles)
- Added responsive mobile styling

### 3. `main.py` - COMPLETED
- Added import for `pull_fx_data`
- Integrated FX data pull into daily pipeline
- Added status logging for FX data fetch

### 4. `requirements.txt` - VERIFIED
- Already includes `requests` library needed for API calls
- No additional dependencies required

## Design Features

### Styling
- Matches existing article box design with border-left accent
- Uses teal (#17a2b8) accent color to distinguish from article categories
- Clean grid layout for currency rates
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Proper typography hierarchy

### Positioning
- Small box positioned at the top, after header but before articles
- Compact but readable layout
- Includes timestamp showing when rates were fetched (in NZ timezone)

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if APIs are unavailable
- Fallback displays "Foreign exchange data currently unavailable"
- Multiple API endpoints for redundancy

## Testing

### Quick Tests Available
1. `python test_fx.py` - Test FX data fetching only
2. `python test_newsletter.py` - Test newsletter generation with FX box
3. `python foreign_exchange_data.py` - Direct test of FX module

### Integration Test
Run the main pipeline to test full integration:
```bash
cd src/mvp_news_aggregator
python main.py
```

## API Usage
- **Traditional FX**: exchangerate-api.com (free, 1500 requests/month)
- **Bitcoin**: CoinGecko API (free, generous limits)
- **Fallback**: CoinDesk API (free, public)

All APIs are free tier and don't require API keys, making deployment simple.

## Next Steps
1. Test the implementation
2. Verify styling matches your design preferences
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Monitor API rate limits in production
5. Consider adding more currency pairs if needed

The implementation is complete and ready for testing!
